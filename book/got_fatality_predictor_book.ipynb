    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "We build a prediction tool that predicts whether a given character from the Game of Thrones books will survive to the end of the series. To do this, we implement a logistic regression model on a data set containing character information. The model is not able to achieve prediction accuracy any better than 65%. This is likely due to an absence of strong patterns in the plot and cast of characters that would allow us to easily answer such a question."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The popular novel series *Game of Thrones* by George R. R. Martin takes place in a fictional world inspired by medeival Europe. Warfare and violence are central to the plot, leading to frequent casualties among the expansive cast of characters. Exactly which characters are fated to die before the end of the series has become a topic of heated speculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis we try to predict whether a character will come to grief before the end of the series based on that character's attributes. We consider a data set created by Data Society available through data.world {cite}`data_society_2016`, which comprises a comprehensive list of characters appearing in the series. For each character there is a number of attributes, such as whether the character is noble, whether they appeared in a given book in the series, whether a relation of theirs is already dead, and finally whether or not the character is still alive at the end.

    "A concern of ours having seen the data is that there are a number of columns which are filled almost completely with missing values. These represent information that is only known for a very small minority of characters, like whether their parents are alive and who their heir is. We decided to drop columns that were almost entirely missing values, like **isAliveFather**. In other cases like **House**, where the missing values represent characters who are not noble and thus do not belong to a house, we filled the missing values with a new category like 'No house'. Also these columns contained a great number of unique categories; for simplicity's sake we decided to keep only the most common categories and filled all the other values with 'other'. Finally for age, which is unknown for about half of the characters, we filled missing values with the median age."

However for class 1 the model's precision is much lower, indicating that it is a bit too quick to predict the demise of a character.

    "Overall the model's accuracy is fairly unimpressive, correctly predicting the fate of a character in only about half of all cases. While this might seem a bit disappointing, it did not particularly surprise or discourage us: George R. R. Martin is a celebrated author and master story teller, and the fact that we can't easily predict a whether a character will survive based on their attributes is a testament to the quality of his writing rather than the inadequacy of our model. Of course, this prediction tool is largely humerous and unlikely to make much of an impact beyond this project, it is nevertheless interesting to have a quanititative assessment of a plotline's predictability!"
